Can you help out with technical documentation? Here are several things you can do.
- Find one of the models online ([here are some examples](https://www.appropedia.org/Open_source_ventilator))
- Open an issue mentioning that you are documenting a specific model
- Make a repo and structure it considering the following folders:
  - `content/docs` folder subfolder for documentation. (Here we can make guides, usage etc.) This can help us later on to present the content in a nice documentation website.
  - `src/` folder for source files, stls, etc
  - Make a simple readme to give context
- List the project under the github organization
  - [Provide your repo in the chat](https://discord.gg/HaXuRQ5)

## Make replication guides of the hardware above
## Make translations of the guides
## Share with people that can do the above if you can't or don't have time
## Is there anything else we are missing?
