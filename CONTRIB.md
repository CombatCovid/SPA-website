- Open an issue mentioning that you are documenting a specific model
- Make a repo and structure it considering the following folders:
  - `content/docs` folder subfolder for documentation. (Here we can make guides, usage etc.) This can help us later on to present the content in a nice documentation website.

  - Make a simple readme to give context
- List the project under the github organization
