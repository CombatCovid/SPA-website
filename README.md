# Combat Covid 
## Easy to find hardware designs to replicate and combat covid19 around the world
- Help me! I am a just designer with some frontend experience
- ðŸ‘‰ [Join the chat](https://discord.gg/HaXuRQ5)
- Take a look at the [project board](https://github.com/CombatCovid/SPA-website/projects/2?fullscreen=true)
- Take over a feature in the issues
- Open a new issue

**Technology stack**: GraphQL, Apollo(?), Vuejs, Gridsome

## Why doing this and what is the problem ?
Around the world many initiatives are poping up to mitigate the shortage of equipment and accesories to treat covid19.
Many designs and groups working on them have been released in various ways and formats. This has been happening through different channels, websites. Here is a [**list of initiatives**](https://openhardware4.me/open-hardware-leaders.github.io/covid19.html).

**The problem we are trying to solve**: The designs(data) being generated is not easy to find, is in different languages, and when it scales to many people participating it becomes a maze of content. Currently the formats, channels and threads are difficult to follow and understand due to the urgency of the moment. We would like to help to improve the process of finding, deciding, replicating and deploying these equipments. 

## What we want to do with this solution
- Improve accessibility of the current designs
- Make easy for contributors to generate replication guides and protocols
  - Experts and lead engineers should be guiding on how to replicate and test this equipment
- Internationalize the documentation with different languages
- Help people connect locally on a peer to peer level
- Capture all the relevant information to facilitate the workgroups which includes:
  - Replication/ build logs
  - Number of succesful replications of the equipment
  - Contact experts available locally
  - Contact makers or facilities available to manufacture a design

## Help wanted for development
- [x] Designer(s) with frontend backend experience
- [ ] Backend developer(s) with expertise in GraphQL and apollo
- [ ] Frontend developer(s) experienced with Vuejs and apollo
- [ ] Lead engineers and developers currently working on initiatives that provide minimum structure of equipment documentation
- [ ] People that want to help out with translation and documentation


## Fastrack approach to facilitate design accesibility (1-2 weeks)
- Use current github platform to capture guides
  - If project leads generate a folder call `docs` containing files in numeric order we could capture those files in the repositories. If people want to do it with different languages the folder could have subfolders with specific notation EN/ES/NL..
- Present list of projects with images and stars in github.


## Using and deploying gridsome locally

This is the project you get when you run `gridsome create new-project`.

### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have

`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Create a Gridsome project

1. `gridsome create my-gridsome-site` to install default starter
2. `cd my-gridsome-site` to open the folder
3. `gridsome develop` to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
4. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ
