            Be sure to know that you're invited here on a working preview, fresh out of
            our latest design progress and rapid implementation, and that the same
            is true of the Design Documents you'll find and may use. </p>
          <p>All will
            increase and improve, yet in our present circumstances, surely it's best
            to get what is clearly useful out to be seen, into the earliest public view.
          </p>
          <p>
            The simple to use Finder in this app will you discover designs, by trying words
           that suggest your interest, then seeing candidates, each with an image and
            a brief description to help you get an idea about it.</p>
          <p>
            Tapping on a cards you see will bring up the Viewer on that design,
            where you'll have a quick Summary, and then be ready to tap or click again,
            into easy reading views over all Design visuals and text Documents.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a tablet or phone, you can just swipe left or right, in the usual way,
            to move rapidly through what's available -- or if you prefer, tap the
            arrow buttons that appear. On a laptop or other larger computer, you also can
            use your keyboard arrow buttons, and scroll right or left in a similar way.
          </p>
          <p>Being able to scan through designs means you'll be able
            to rapidly appreciate what the built result is actually going to be like,
            and that should help in coming to important judgements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speed and ease, across culture, situations, and needs, are the things we are after.
          </p>
          <p>
            What will follow, for one example, as we integrate features,
            will include the ability to Bookmark the designs you want to
            be able to immediately return to, thus compare them quickly.</p>
          <p>We're looking forward to this -- and to just a few further things...</p>
          <p>Thank you for visiting, on our early days.</p>
