            Be sure to know that you're viewing a site fresh out of our own latest design revision,
            progress, and rapid implementation, beginning with the Viewer now able to proceed very easily
            from its Summary to an easy reading view of all Design Documents. </p>
          <p>
            This is paired with similarly swipable and clickable visuals just above,
            so that you can rapidly appreciate what the built result is actually
            going to be like, in this help to important judgements.
          </p>
          <p>
            You'll discover the candidate designs from the Finder, aided by a quite intelligent
            and very rapid keywords search agent behind the scenes, then just click to have
            all these details in the Viewer.</p>
          <p>
            Speed and ease, across culture, situations, and needs, are the things we are after.
          </p>
          <p>
            What follows, for example, as we integrate a local memory feature for it,
            will be the ability to Bookmark the designs you want to
            be able to immediately return to.</p>
          <p>We're looking forward to this -- and just a few further things...</p>
          <p>Thank you for visiting, on our early days.</p>
